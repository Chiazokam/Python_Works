Deleting an item from a hash table using chaining for collision resolution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To delete an item from a hash table that uses chaining for collision resolution,
the hash value of the item is first derived using the modulo division.
Since the chaining method places multiple items on a single slot (Implemented
with a list), a sequential search is done on the slot and item deleted when found
